Considered Options MADR 2.1.2 - The Markdown Architectural Decision Records Michael Nygard's template - The first incarnation of the term \"ADR\" Sustainable Architectural Decisions - The Y-Statements Other templates listed at https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record Formless - No conventions for file format and structure Decision Outcome Chosen option: \"MADR 2.1.2\", because Implicit assumptions should be made explicit. Design documentation is important to enable people understanding the decisions later on. See also A rational design process: How and why to fake it . The MADR format is lean and fits our development style. The MADR structure is comprehensible and facilitates usage & maintenance. The MADR project is vivid. Version 2.1.2 is the latest one available when starting to document ADRs. Positive Consequences The ADR are more structured. See especially: * MADR-0002 - Do not use numbers in headings . * MADR-0005 - Use (unique number and) dashes in filenames . * MADR-0010 - Support categories (in form of subfolders with local ids) . * See full set of MADR ADRs .
